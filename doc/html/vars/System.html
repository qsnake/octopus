<br/><i>Default</i>: 3
<br/><br> <tt>Octopus</tt> can run in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions, depending on the value of this
 variable. Note that not all input variables may be available in all cases.

<p><b><a name='PeriodicDimensions'></a>PeriodicDimensions</b>
<br/><i>Section</i>: System
<br/><i>Type</i>: integer
<br/><br> Define how many directions are to be considered periodic. It has to be a number
 between zero and <tt>Dimensions</tt>.

<br/><i>Options</i>:
<ul>
<li><b>0</b>:  No direction is periodic (molecule).
</li>
<li><b>1</b>:  The <i>x</i> direction is periodic (wire, polymer).
</li>
<li><b>2</b>:  The <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions are periodic (slab).

<p><b><a name='Coordinates'></a>Coordinates</b>
<br/><i>Section</i>: System::Coordinates
<br/><i>Type</i>: block
<br/><br> If neither <tt>XYZCoordinates</tt> nor <tt>PDBCoordinates</tt> was found, <tt>Octopus</tt>
 tries to read the coordinates for the atoms from the block <tt>Coordinates</tt>. The
 format is quite straightforward:
<br><br>
 <tt>%Coordinates
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'C' |      -0.56415 | 0.0 | 0.0 | no
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'O' | &nbsp;0.56415 | 0.0 | 0.0 | no
 <br>%</tt>
<br><br>
 The first line defines a carbon atom at coordinates ("-0.56415", "0.0", "0.0"),
 that is <b>not</b> allowed to move during dynamical simulations. The second line has
 a similar meaning. This block obviously defines a carbon monoxide molecule, if the
 input units are <tt>eV_Angstrom</tt>. Note that in this way it is possible to fix some of the atoms (this
 is not possible when specifying the coordinates through a <tt>PDBCoordinates</tt> or
 <tt>XYZCoordinates</tt> file). It is always possible to fix <b>all</b> atoms using the <tt>MoveIons</tt> directive.

</p><hr width='30%' align='left'/>


<p><b><a name='PDBCoordinates'></a>PDBCoordinates</b>
<br/><i>Section</i>: System::Coordinates
<br/><i>Type</i>: string
<br/><br> If this variable is present, the program tries to read the atomic coordinates
 from the file specified by its value. The PDB (Protein Data Bank,
 <tt>http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/</tt>) format is quite complicated, and it goes
 well beyond the scope of this manual. You can find a comprehensive
 description <a href='http://www.wwpdb.org/docs.html'>here</a>.
 From the plethora of instructions defined in the PDB standard, <tt>Octopus</tt>
 only reads two, <tt>ATOM</tt> and <tt>HETATOM</tt>. From these fields, it reads:
 <ul>
 <li> columns 13-16: The species; in fact <tt>Octopus</tt> only cares about the
 first letter - "CA" and "CB" will both refer to carbon - so elements whose
 chemical symbol has more than one letter cannot be represented in this way.
 So, if you want to run mercury (Hg), please use one of the other two methods
 to input the coordinates: <tt>XYZCoordinates</tt> or <tt>Coordinates</tt>.</li>
 <li> columns 18-21: The residue. If residue is <tt>QM</tt>, the atom is treated by quantum
 mechanics; otherwise it is simply treated as an external classical point charge.
 Its charge will be given by columns 61-65.</li>
 <li> columns 31-54: The Cartesian coordinates. The Fortran format is <tt>(3f8.3)</tt>.</li>
 <li> columns 61-65: Classical charge of the atom. The Fortran format is <tt>(f6.2)</tt>.</li>
 </ul>

<p><b><a name='ReducedCoordinates'></a>ReducedCoordinates</b>
<br/><i>Section</i>: System::Coordinates
<br/><i>Type</i>: block
<br/><br> This block gives the atomic coordinates relative to the real
 space unit cell. The format is the same as the
 <tt>Coordinates</tt> block.
<br><br>
 Note that in Octopus the origin of coordinates is in the center
 of the cell, so the coordinates inside the cell are in the
 range [-0.5, 0.5).
<br><br>
 This block cannot be used with the <tt>minimum</tt> box shapes.
<br><br>

</p><hr width='30%' align='left'/>


<p><b><a name='XYZCoordinates'></a>XYZCoordinates</b>
<br/><i>Section</i>: System::Coordinates
<br/><i>Type</i>: string
<br/><br> If <tt>PDBCoordinates</tt> is not present, the program reads the atomic coordinates from
 the XYZ file specified by the variable <tt>XYZCoordinates</tt> -- in case this variable
 is present. The XYZ format is very simple: The first line of the file has an integer
 indicating the number of atoms. The second can contain comments that are simply ignored by
 <tt>Octopus</tt>. Then there follows one line per atom, containing the chemical species and
 the Cartesian coordinates of the atom.

<p><b><a name='IonicInteraction'></a>IonicInteraction</b>
<br/><i>Section</i>: System::Species
<br/><i>Type</i>: block
<br/><br> This block defines the type of classical interaction between
 ions. Each line represents the interaction between two types of
 species. The first two columns contain the element symbols, the
 next column is the type of interaction as defined below. The
 next columns are the parameters for the interaction (if
 any). Pairs not specified interact through Coulomb`s law.
<br><br>
 Note: In most cases there is no need to specify this block,
 since Coulomb interaction will be used by default.
<br><br>

<br/><i>Options</i>:
<ul>
<li><b>coulomb</b>:  Particles interact according to Coulomb`s law. The interaction
 strength is given by the charge of the species. There are no
 parameters.
</li>
<li><b>lennard_jones</b>:  (Experimental) The Lennard-Jones 12-6 model potential. It has
 the form <math>V(r) = 4\epsilon((\sigma/r)^12 -
 (\sigma/r)^6)</math>.  The next 2 columns contain the
 <math>\epsilon</math> and <math>\sigma</math> (given in the
 corresponding input file units).
</li>
</ul>
</p><hr width='30%' align='left'/>


<p><b><a name='Species'></a>Species</b>
<br/><i>Section</i>: System::Species
<br/><i>Type</i>: block
<br/><br> A species is by definition either an "ion" (nucleus + core electrons) described
 through a pseudopotential, or a user-defined model potential.
<br><br>
 Note that some common pseudopotentials are distributed with the code in the
 directory <tt>OCTOPUS-HOME/share/PP/</tt>. To use these pseudopotentials you are
 not required to define them explicitly in the <tt>Species</tt> block, as defaults
 are provided by the program (you can override these defaults in any case).
 Additional pseudopotentials can be downloaded from the
 <a href='http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Pseudopotentials'>
 octopus homepage</a>.
<br><br>
 The format of this block is the following: The first field is
 the name of the species, followed by the atomic mass (in atomic mass
 units). The third field defines the type of species (the valid options
 are detailed below). Each type also needs some parameters given in
 the remaining fields of the row.
<br><br>
 In 3D, <i>e.g.</i>
<br><br>
 <tt>%Species
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'O'       | 15.9994 | spec_ps_psf         | 8   | 1 | 1
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'H'       |  1.0079 | spec_ps_hgh         | 1   | 0 | 0
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'jlm'     | 23.2    | spec_jelli          | 8   | 5.0
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'rho'     | 17.0    | spec_charge_density | 6   | "exp(-r/a)"
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'pnt'     | 32.3    | spec_point          | 2.0
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'udf'     |  0.0    | spec_user_defined   | 8   | "1/2*r^2"
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'H_all'   |  1.0079 | spec_full_delta     | 1
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'H_all'   |  1.0079 | spec_full_gaussian  | 1
 <br>%</tt>
<br><br>
 Additionally, all the pseudopotential types (PSF, HGH, FHI, UPF) can take two extra
 fields: default spacing, and default radius (used for minimum simulation box if the
 radius is not specified).

<br/><i>Options</i>:
<ul>
<li><b>spec_ps_psf</b>:  Troullier Martins pseudopotential in <tt>SIESTA</tt> format: the pseudopotential will be
 read from a <tt>.psf</tt> file, either in the working
 directory or in the <tt>OCTOPUS-HOME/share/octopus/PP/PSF</tt> directory.
 Columns 4, 5, 6 are the atomic number, the maximum
 <i>l</i>-component of the pseudopotential to consider in the
 calculation, and the <i>l</i>-component to consider as local.
</li>
<li><b>spec_ps_hgh</b>:  Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter pseudopotentials: column 4 is
 the atomic number and columns 5 and 6 are irrelevant, since they
 are not necessary to define the HGH pseudopotential.
</li>
<li><b>spec_ps_cpi</b>:  Fritz-Haber pseudopotential: the pseudopotential will be
 read from a <tt>.cpi</tt> file, either in the working
 directory or in the <tt>OCTOPUS-HOME/share/PP/CPI</tt> directory.
 Columns 4, 5, 6 are the atomic number, the maximum
 <i>l</i>-component of the pseudopotential to consider in the
 calculation, and the <i>l</i>-component to consider as local.
</li>
<li><b>spec_ps_fhi</b>:  Fritz-Haber pseudopotential (<tt>ABINIT</tt> format): the pseudopotential will be
 read from a <tt>.fhi</tt> file, either in the working
 directory or in the <tt>OCTOPUS-HOME/share/PP/FHI</tt> directory.
 Columns 4, 5, 6 are the atomic number, the maximum
 <i>l</i>-component of the pseudopotential to consider in the
 calculation, and the <i>l</i>-component to consider as local.
 Note that you can use the pseudopotentials from <tt>ABINIT</tt> homepage.
</li>
<li><b>spec_ps_upf</b>:  UPF format: the pseudopotential will be
 read from a <tt>.UPF</tt> file, either in the working
 directory or in the <tt>OCTOPUS-HOME/share/PP/UPF</tt> directory.
 Column 4 is the atomic number. Columns 5 and 6 are
 ignored, as the maximum <i>l</i>-component of the pseudopotential to
 consider in the calculation and the <i>l</i>-component to consider as
 local are indicated in the pseudopotential file are cannot be changed.
</li>
<li><b>spec_user_defined</b>:  Species with user-defined potential. In this case, the fourth
 field is the valence charge and the fifth
 field is a string with a mathematical expression that defines the
 potential (you can use any of the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>
 or <i>r</i> variables).
</li>
<li><b>spec_full_gaussian</b>:  A full-potential atom is defined by a Gaussian accumulation of
 positive charge (distorted if curvilinear coordinates are
 used), in the form:
<br><br>
 <math>
 q(r) = z * \beta * exp[ - (\vec{r}-\vec{r0})**2 / (sqrt(2) * \delta * \sigma) ]
 </math>
<br><br>
 <math>\beta</math> is chosen in order to maintain proper
 normalization (the integral of <math>q</math> should sum up to
 <math>z</math>). <math>\delta</math> is the grid spacing (the
 grid spacing in the first dimension, to be precise).
 <math>\vec{r0}</math> is calculated in such a way that the the
 first moment of <math>q(r)/z</math> is equal to the atomic
 position. For a precise description, see N. A. Modine,
 <i>Phys. Rev. B</i> <b>55</b>, 10289 (1997).
<br><br>
 Column 4 is the atomic number and column 5 is
 <math>sigma</math>, the width of the gaussian that should be
 small, but you may run into numerical difficulties if it is too
 small (0.25 by default).
</li>
<li><b>spec_charge_density</b>:  The potential is created by a distribution of charge. The extra parameters are the
 valence charge of the species, and an expression for the charge distribution.
</li>
<li><b>species_from_file</b>:  The potential is read from a file, whose name is given in column 5.
</li>
<li><b>spec_full_delta</b>:  Full atomic potential represented by a delta charge
 distribution. The atom will be displaced to the nearest grid
 point. Column 4 is the atomic number.
</li>
<li><b>spec_point</b>:  Point charge: the fourth field is the value of the charge.
</li>
<li><b>spec_jelli</b>:  Jellium sphere: the extra parameters are the charge of the jellium
 sphere (an equal value of valence charge is assumed) and the radius of
 the sphere.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b><a name='SpeciesProjectorSphereThreshold'></a>SpeciesProjectorSphereThreshold</b>
<br/><i>Section</i>: System::Species
<br/><i>Type</i>: float
<br/><i>Default</i>: 0.001
<br/><br> The pseudopotentials may be composed of a local part, and a linear combination of nonlocal
 operators. These nonlocal projectors have "projector" form, |<i>v</i>&gt;&lt;<i>v</i>| (or, more generally
 speaking, |<i>u</i>&gt;&lt;<i>v</i>|). These projectors are localized in real space -- that is, the function <i>v</i>
 has a finite support around the nucleus. This region where the projectors are localized should
 be small or else the computation time required to operate with them will be very large.
<br><br>
 In practice, this localization is fixed by requiring the definition of the projectors to be
 contained in a sphere of a certain radius. This radius is computed by making sure that the
 absolute value of the projector functions, at points outside the localization sphere, is
 below a certain threshold. This threshold is set by <tt>SpeciesProjectorSphereThreshold</tt>.

<br/><i>Default</i>: no
<br/><br> When this variable is set, the potential defined in the block <tt>Species</tt> is calculated

<p><b><a name='RandomVelocityTemp'></a>RandomVelocityTemp</b>
<br/><i>Section</i>: System::Velocities
<br/><i>Type</i>: float
<br/><br> If this variable is present, <tt>Octopus</tt> will assign random

 temperature given by <tt>RandomVelocityTemp</tt> (in degrees Kelvin).

</p><hr width='30%' align='left'/>


<p><b><a name='Velocities'></a>Velocities</b>
<br/><i>Section</i>: System::Velocities
<br/><i>Type</i>: block
<br/><br> If <tt>XYZVelocities</tt> is not present, octopus will try to fetch the initial

 will reset the initial velocities to zero. The format of this block can be
 illustrated by this example:
<br><br>
 <tt>%Velocities
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'C'  |      -1.7 | 0.0 | 0.0
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;'O'  | &nbsp;1.7 | 0.0 | 0.0
 <br>%</tt>
<br><br>
 It describes one carbon and one oxygen moving at the relative
 velocity of 3.4 velocity units.
<br><br>
 Note: It is important for the velocities to maintain the ordering
 in which the species were defined in the coordinates specifications.

<p><b><a name='XYZVelocities'></a>XYZVelocities</b>
<br/><i>Section</i>: System::Velocities

 specified by the variable <tt>XYZVelocities</tt>.
 Note that you do not need to specify initial velocities if you are not going
 to perform ion dynamics; if you are going to allow the ions to move but the velocities
 are not specified, they are considered to be null.
